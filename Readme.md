# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for macOS. Tuned to work with Apple's Terminal.app

&hearts; the Vim.

## Commands

The main tasks are `Makefile` targets. To see the available commands provided by
the `install`, `uninstall`, `update` and `help` scripts run:

```
make help
```

## Tips

### Git credentials

To setup your git credentials you'll need to add a `.gitconfig.local` file to
your `$HOME` directory and add the following:

```
[user]
  name = YOUR_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
  email = YOUR_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
  signingKey = YOUR_GIT_SIGNING_KEY
[github]
  user = YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

Note: Git will ignore `*.local` files. The `install`/`uninstall` script
symlinks/removes a `gitconfig.local`.

### GPG

Install GPG Keychain for GPG signing to happen automatically. See [GPG
Tools][gpg_tools] for more information. To get your GPG signing key you can
either open up GPG Keychain, or run `gpg --list-keys` and add this to in your
`.gitconfig.local` file. If you are transferring a key to a new computer
see [the knowledge base article][gpg_transfer]

### Install Terminal.app themes

Included in the vimrc is `Plug mkitt/pigment`. This is the color settings for
Vim. Any color profile should work with this theme including the defaults from
Apple. Included from the [pigment][pigment] repository are light and dark
profiles. Import these profiles into Apple's Terminal.app and set one as the
default. The location of the profiles is:

```
~/.vim/plugged/pigment/profiles/
```
